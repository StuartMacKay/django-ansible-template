# Example inventory for a production deploy

# The domain name is only needed for production and uses a variable because:
# 1) Django's ALLOWED_HOSTS setting needs to be set to either inventory_hostname
#    for deploys or ansible_hostname when running the molecule tests using Docker
# 2) Nginx's server_name directive is either set to inventory_hostname when it is
#    set to a fully-qualified domain name or the catch-all empty string for local
#    deployments or when running tests.
# The two situations overlap and introducing a new variable was the simplest and
# most unambiguous solution. See,
# molecule/default/molecule.yml, line 25
# roles/django/defaults/main.yml, line 19
# roles/django/templates/nginx_config.js, lines 14, 27, 29, 46/
